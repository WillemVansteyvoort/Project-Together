# Project Together

Project-Together is designed to help companies and groups organize their projects. We offer various options to easily collaborate in a well-organized manner. Our most important asset is to provide small companies with a free version with the same functionalities as the pro version. Project-Together is the first free project management tool.

The development of Project-Together was started in 2018. The first version was published in the summer of 2019. Originally, Project-Together was a final task for an IT course in the secondary school called Busleyden Atheneum Campus Zandpoort that's located in Malines, Belgium.
